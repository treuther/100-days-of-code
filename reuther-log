Day 1: I have no idea how to use GitHub lol! So any guidance on setting this thing up the right way, much appreciated.
I'm joining the challenge because I need to commit and need the accountability. AND! Have no idea how to use GitHub and this would be a good introduction.
Wish me luck! And my apologies if I didn't do this right :-)
